# Gaming_tournament
This platform needs to enable users to join and participate in tournaments. The engineer will need to have knowledge in Solidity and Hardhat in order to implement the following flow: - User joins a web interface - User sees a list of active tournaments - User joins a tournament - User waits in the lobby-Once the tournament lobby reaches a specified NUMBER_OF_USERS, the tournament STARTs
- Once the tournament ENDs, the system calculates the scores and plots the
leaderboard
